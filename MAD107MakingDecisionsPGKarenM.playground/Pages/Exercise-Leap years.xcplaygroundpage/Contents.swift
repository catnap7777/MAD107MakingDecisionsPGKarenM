 ## Exercise: Leap Years
 
 To decide if a year is a leap year, there are several decisions that have to be made:
 
 - Is the year divisible by 4?
    - If so, is the year divisible by 100?
        - If not, it is a leap year.
        - If so, is the year divisible by 400?
            - If not, it is **not** a leap year.
            - If so, it is a leap year.
 
 These decisions can be made inside a function.
 
 The `number(_:, isDivisibleBy:)` function has been built into this playground to make this exercise easier. Below is an incomplete function for deciding if a given year is a leap year:
*/
func isLeapYear(_ year: Int) -> Bool {
    if number(year, isDivisibleBy: 4) {
        if year % 100 == 0 {
            if year % 400 == 0 {
                return true
            } else {
                return false
            }
        } else {
            return true
        }
        // Fill in this code...
        //return true
    } else {
        return false
    }
}

//.. rewritten using guard statements
func isLeapYear2(_ year: Int) -> Bool {
    
    if number(year, isDivisibleBy: 4) {
        
        //.. is it divisible by 100?  If not, then it's a leap year
        guard year % 100 == 0 else {
            return true
        }
        
        //.. if it was divisible by 100, is it also divisible by 400? If not, then it's not a leap year
        guard year % 400 == 0 else {
            return false
        }
        
        //.. if divisible by 4... and if divisible by 100... and divisible by 400, then it's a leap year
        return true
        
    } else {
        //.. if not divisible by 4
        return false
    }
}

// Should be true
var value1a = isLeapYear(2000)
var value1b = isLeapYear2(2000)
print("func isLeapYear1 with \"if stmts\" = \(value1a)")
print("func isLeapYear2 with \"guard stmts\" = \(value1b)\n")

// Should be false
var value2a = isLeapYear(1900)
var value2b = isLeapYear2(1900)
print("func isLeapYear1 with \"if stmts\"= \(value2a)")
print("func isLeapYear2 with \"guard stmts\" = \(value2b)\n")

// Should be true
var value3a = isLeapYear(2012)
var value3b = isLeapYear2(2012)
print("func isLeapYear1 with \"if stmts\"= \(value3a)")
print("func isLeapYear2 with \"guard stmts\" = \(value3b)\n")

// Should be false
var value4a = isLeapYear(2017)
var value4b = isLeapYear2(2017)
print("func isLeapYear1 with \"if stmts\"= \(value4a)")
print("func isLeapYear2 with \"guard stmts\" = \(value4b)\n")


//: - callout(Exercise): Complete the function above so that the rules are all followed and the examples get the correct answers.
